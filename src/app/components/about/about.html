                    I'm a passionate full-stack engineer with a deep commitment to building
                    high-quality, scalable applications. With 09+ years of professional experience, I've
                    had the privilege of working on diverse projects ranging from healthcare platforms
                    to supply chain management systems.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    My expertise spans across Microsoft technologies (.NET, .NET Core), modern frontend
                    frameworks (Angular 2+), cloud services (Azure), and databases (SQL Server). I'm
                    particularly passionate about clean architecture, test-driven development, and
                    mentoring the next generation of engineers.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    I believe in continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technology trends,
                    whether it's the latest Angular versions, cloud-native architectures, or emerging
                    patterns in software design.
